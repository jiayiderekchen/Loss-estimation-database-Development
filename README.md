# Loss estimation Database Development and Optimization 

* Disclaimer: none of the data or models used in this repository are related to any physical entities. Itâ€™s just a showcase of my personal work.

This is a end-to-end production level project regarding the construction and development of P&C database, as well as work with data objects, run SQL queries, design functions, etc. 

In this project, I completed three major goals: 
1) Designed, Configured database schemas.  
2) Migrated total amount of 10-millions of datasets from IBM DB2 to cloud database called snowflake.
3) Used Apache Spark, Hive, and Apache Hadoop to boost the efficiency of database.
